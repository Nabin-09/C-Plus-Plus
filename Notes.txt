Pointers :
Variable have an address in memory.
pointer is a special kind of variable that holds the addresses of variables.
we can have a pointer to anything in cpp.
DECLARING AND USING POINTERS :
 
code  : 
 int* p_number{nullptr}; // can store addresses of variables type int only.
 double* p_fractional_number{nullptr};//can store addresses of variables type double only.
    //Explicitly  initialize to null pointer.
    cout<<"Size of number pointer : "<<sizeof(p_number)
        <<" , size of int : "<<sizeof(int)<<endl; //Size of number pointer : 4 , size of int : 4
    cout<<"Size of fractional_number pointer : "<<sizeof(p_fractional_number)
        <<" , size of int : "<<sizeof(double)<<endl; //Size of fractional_number pointer : 4 , size of int : 8
     p_var = &var2;
    cout<<"Number is : "<<var2;//Printing what's the number is 
    cout<<"  , p_var its address is : "<<p_var<<endl;//Printing whats the address of integer.
    //Number is : 43  , p_var its address is : 0x61ff04
Hence , we can assign new values to an initialised pointer.
we use "*" as dereferencing operator.
cout<<*p_val<<endl//prints value stored in var1;
